Welcome to my Quotes Quest Game!

In this story game, you'll have to choose between two path - light and dark. 
Whicever path you choose, you'll play a mini game which may either be catching light orbs 
or trying to finding your way out of the dark maze. 

Comming Soon Feature: I will add a quote generator soon that will geenrate a either a deep quote
or one that motivates you when your down. 

How I made this game:
I follow a similar syntax to my a previous project I made with Girls Who Code. 
I used the p5.js library for my code. 
I got some assistance from AI to help merge the light path minigame with the main script.js file 
(as creating them separatly wasn't working out).
For the images, they are AI generated. 

Updateas to come very soon:
Adding music 
Adding quote generator
